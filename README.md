• Conducted a comprehensive statistical analysis to investigate the difference in insulin levels between breast cancer patients and healthy individuals.

• Utilized both bootstrap and asymptotic methods to calculate confidence intervals for means and medians, supporting the hypothesis that breast cancer patients have higher insulin levels.

• Demonstrated statistical significance in the differences, rejecting the null hypothesis.

• Highlighted potential implications for public health awareness, health management, and future research related to breast cancer and insulin levels.
